# Videos

## Playback

Openpilot records high-res videos in raw HEVC format. Playing these directly in the browser requires client-side conversion using WebAssembly FFmpeg, which can take 10+ seconds before playback starts depending on your hardware. Low-res videos play instantly.

Playback settings:
- **Large Camera** - primary video source (Road, Wide, Driver, or Quantized for low-res)
- **Small Camera** - optional second camera displayed alongside the primary view (Road, Wide, Driver, or Off)
- **Openpilot UI** - overlay showing speed, alerts, and driving state. Options are Full (requires qlog files uploaded) or Quantized (uses lighter qlog data)
- **Show Path** - display the predicted driving path overlay

With [Asius API](/api), we convert HEVC to MP4 server-side, so high-res video playback is instant.

## Download

Download options for video files:
- **Raw segment files** - original HEVC files as recorded by openpilot
- **Segment MP4** - client-side converted MP4 for a single segment
- **Full route MP4** - complete route video for any camera (Road, Wide, Driver)

## Rendering

Click the render button in the player to export your video as MP4. The render uses your current playback settings - start/end times, camera selection, and UI overlay are all included in the final output.

All rendering happens client-side, no data is sent to external servers. With [Asius API](/api), rendering is faster since videos are already in MP4 format and don't need client-side HEVC conversion first.
