# Self hosting

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asiusai/connect
cd asiusai
bun i
bun run self-host # (or `cd api && bun run start`)
```

## Environment

Create a `.env` file in the `api` folder:

```bash
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key

# Auth (at least one required)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=...
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=...

# Optional
PORT=8080
STORAGE_PATH=/tmp/asius
DB_PATH=/tmp/asius.db
SUPERUSERS=user@email.com,another@email.com
```

## Tailscale (recommended)

Expose your server to the internet without port forwarding:

```bash
# Install tailscale, then:
tailscale up
tailscale funnel 8080
```

Set `TAILSCALE=1` in your `.env` to use the funnel URL automatically.

## Storage

By default files are stored locally at `STORAGE_PATH`.

For remote WebDAV storage (like Hetzner Storage Box):

```bash
STORAGEBOX_URL=https://user:pass@u123456.your-storagebox.de
```

## Connect

After the server starts it gives you connect URL like this: `https://connect.asius.ai/add-provider?info=ey...`.
Go to that URL to add this provider to your device.
