## Ideas

- ~~Everything working that is in the old connect~~
- ~~Easy download video files as mp4~~
- Replace snapshot with a live stream
- [Sentry mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laO0RzsDzfU)
- Car mangement: lock doors, EV charge status, and everything else you can do with CAN ()
- Manage comma device settings, change forks, update etc
- See live CAN messages, show stats and dashboards based on that
- Android and iOS apps
- Teleop your car or comma body (joystick and in VR)
- Control comma device over bluetooth
- [Buttons](https://www.enhauto.com/products/four-s3xy-buttons-bundle)
- Navigate with OP
- Waze? (can't be installed in teslas, so I would like comma to notify on cameras and stuff)
- Chat and manage future comma bodies
- Open car doors if your phone connects to bluetooth and is close to the car
- Route OG images and shareble videos for every route
- Openpilot wrapped, show yearly or all time stats in a video
- External batterybank that you can connect to the harness so that it during sentry mode it uses that, not the car battery. charges when ignition is on again
